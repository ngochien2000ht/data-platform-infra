# k8s

This directory contains Kubernetes manifests and placeholder files that mirror the repository organization. Use these files as the starting point for ArgoCD applications, platform components and service manifests.

Structure created here is intentionally minimal and contains placeholders for:
- argocd/applications
- services (kafka, minio, airflow...)
- platform (cert-manager, monitoring...)
- environments (dev/staging/prod values)

Replace placeholders with your real manifests or Helm chart values.
